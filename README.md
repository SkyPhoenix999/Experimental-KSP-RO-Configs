**OTHER MODS**

I have configured other mods for RealismOverhaul, the reason they aren't in this download is because they have separate existing repositories.
You can find those configus through these links.

Bluedog_DB: https://github.com/SkyPhoenix999/Bluedog_DB-RO-Configs
ORANGES: https://github.com/SkyPhoenix999/ORANGES_RO
Artemis Construction Kit: https://github.com/SkyPhoenix999/Artemis-Construction-Kit-RO-Configs
Tundra Exploration (Kerbal Reusability Expansion and Tundra Technologies Included): https://github.com/SkyPhoenix999/TundraExploration_RO
  

**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS**:
	  1: Install RealismOverhaul (CKAN Express Install or manual, doesn't matter) and any of the mods supported here
 
	  2: Open the GameData Folder and drop the RealismOverhaul Folder included in the download into the folder (Select Replace Files when prompted)
  
	  5: **OPTIONAL ENGINE INCLUSION (SEE BELOW)**
  
	  6: Done, load up the game and have fun


**IF YOU WANT ALL THE ENGINES (OPTIONAL)**:

Note: If you go through with this, not only will the engines from these mods appear, but all engines from other mods that would otherwise be duplicates, you will likely need a part tab manager like Janitor's Closet.
  
	  6.1: Open the ROEngines Folder inside the GameData Folder
  
	  6.2: Delete the PatchManager Folder

NOTES:

- This download includes Support for only the mods listed and will keep up with Development Updates as time goes on.

- This is a Beta Download, there are bugs and not everything is 100% complete, but everything here should work.

- RP1 not supported.
